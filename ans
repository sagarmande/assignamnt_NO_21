Let's go through each of your tasks step by step:

1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.

```python
import datetime

current_date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
with open("today.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(current_date)
```

2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string.

```python
with open("today.txt", "r") as file:
    today_string = file.read()
```

3. Parse the date from today_string.

```python
from datetime import datetime

parsed_date = datetime.strptime(today_string, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

4. List the files in your current directory.

```python
import os

current_directory = os.listdir()
print("Files in current directory:", current_directory)
```

5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).

```python
parent_directory = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), os.pardir))
files_in_parent_directory = os.listdir(parent_directory)
print("Files in parent directory:", files_in_parent_directory)
```

6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.

```python
import multiprocessing
import random
import time
from datetime import datetime

def print_current_time():
    wait_time = random.randint(1, 5)
    time.sleep(wait_time)
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    print("Current time:", current_time)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = []
    for _ in range(3):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_current_time)
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()
    
    for process in processes:
        process.join()
```

7. Create a date object of your day of birth.

Replace "YYYY-MM-DD" with your actual birthdate.

```python
from datetime import date

birthdate = date(YYYY, MM, DD)
```

8. What day of the week was your day of birth?

```python
day_of_week = birthdate.strftime("%A")
print("Day of the week of your birth:", day_of_week)
```

9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?

```python
from datetime import timedelta

ten_thousand_days = timedelta(days=10000)
future_date = birthdate + ten_thousand_days
print("You will be (or were) 10,000 days old on:", future_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
```

Make sure to replace "YYYY", "MM", and "DD" with your actual birth year, month, and day in task 7 and adjust the output accordingly in task 8 and 9.
